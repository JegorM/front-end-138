            Monster Truck Booster is here to take your gaming experience to new
            heights—literally. This online 2D driving game combines classic
            monster truck mechanics with a quirky twist: a powerful booster that
            launches your truck into the air. Whether you're climbing steep
            slopes or leaping over wild ramps, the challenge is all about
            precision and flair. But what makes this game truly stand out? It's
            not just the gravity-defying stunts but also the thrill of nailing
            those perfect landings. Hold the space key to charge up your booster
            and release it to fly through the air. Time your boosts carefully,
            as a poorly timed launch could send you flipping out of control. The
            goal? Land smoothly and complete all 30 racetracks. Let’s dive
            deeper into what makes Monster Truck Booster an absolute must-play.

          <h2>Gameplay Mechanics</h2>
          <p>
            At its core, Monster Truck Booster is about balance, timing, and
            having a blast. Here’s what you can expect:

            <li>
              The longer you hold the boost, the higher and farther your truck
              flies. Mastering the booster is key to overcoming obstacles and
              achieving those sweet, high-flying stunts.
            </li>
            <li>
              With 30 uniquely designed levels, there’s no shortage of
              excitement. Each level presents new obstacles, steeper slopes, and
              tougher ramps.
            </li>
            <li>
              Coins, scattered throughout each level, allow you to unlock
              cooler, more powerful monster trucks. Because let’s face it,
              bigger wheels mean bigger thrills.
            </li>
            <li>
              Soaring through the air is fun, but the real challenge lies in
              nailing those landings. One wrong move, and you’ll be flipping out
              like literally!
